# Textmate Bundle for Terraform

A simple-ish Terraform grammar for TextMate. This bundle takes a lot of cues from the JSON bundle, Python bundle, and Ruby bundle.

Currently supports:
 - String interpolation
 - Code folding
 - symbol table for resource identifiers
 - Some simple snippets for creating some resource blocks
